# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is a Python project completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification.

`Project Description`

This project includes a function `calculate()` that uses NumPy to compute statistical properties — mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum — for a given 3x3 matrix.

The function accepts a list of exactly 9 numerical values, reshapes them into a 3x3 NumPy array, and returns a dictionary containing the calculated statistics along the rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.

If the input list does not contain exactly 9 numbers, the function raises a `ValueError`.

`Skills Demonstrated`


- NumPy array creation and reshaping
- Axis-wise statistical computations
- Dictionary structuring for data output
- Error handling with Python exceptions
- Clean and modular Python code
